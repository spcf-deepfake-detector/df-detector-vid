# How does the Deep fake Detection work?

The DeepFake Detection Video project uses a pre-trained model to detect deepfake videos. The model is trained on a dataset of real and fake videos to learn the differences between them. The model uses a technique called deep learning to analyze the videos and identify patterns that indicate whether a video is real or fake.

## [1_video_data_processor.py](/1_video_data_processor.py)

1. First we would setup and download the datasets from the internet and other sources.
2. We would put the dataset folders, output folders, if we want to resume the processing of data, if we want to use_face_detection, frame_sampling_rate, and num_workers.
3. The VideoDataProcessor would now then create a directory where it would put the processed data.
4. After that the script would extract the frames from video to .npy file, which would be used by the detector to train.
5. After processing the data it would save all it's processed frames, and metadata.csv to the output_folder specified by the user.

## [deepfake_data.py](/deepfake_data.py)

1. User would first specify the training and validation data paths, output_dir, and resume_checkpoint (If user has trained a model before).
2. Then the script would transform the dataset (transformations are designed to augment the dataset, making the model more robust and capable of handling a variety of real-world scenarios).
3. Then it would load and verify the dataset - train_dataset and val_dataset
4. After that the script used dataloader for efficient loading and batching data during the training and validation phases of a machine learning model, ensuring that the data is fed to the model in a manner that optimizes performance and resource utilization.
5. Initialize the model and trainer
6. Then the model would now start training until it would get a satisfiable result.

## [inference.py](/inference.py)

1. In here user can now use the trained model for inference.
2. They can put the video for the model to infer (predict).
3. Then it would show the inference results.

## Deep fake detector model

## How does it predict?

The neural network learns to detect deepfakes by identifying subtle visual inconsistencies through its convolutional layers. Unlike human perception of artifacts, the model:

1. Learns Subtle Patterns:

- Extracts hierarchical features from faces
- Detects microscopic inconsistencies in pixel-level details
- Recognizes unnatural texture, lighting, and facial symmetry variations

2. Technical Detection Mechanisms:

- Convolutional layers analyze local and global image features
- Dropout and batch normalization help generalize learning
- Learns to distinguish synthetic vs real facial characteristics

3. Training Process:

- Trained on labeled dataset of real and fake images
- Learns to create a decision boundary between authentic and manipulated faces
- Uses machine learning to statistically distinguish synthetic content

The model essentially performs a mathematically sophisticated version of pattern recognition, detecting deepfakes through computational analysis of visual inconsistencies invisible to casual human observation.
